Running the tests
=================
You can run the tests with "./chessd test".  The server must be running
or you will get an error.  To run a specific test, use e.g.
"trial test.test_kibitz.TestXkibitz".

The tests assume the database and server are a clean state; most notably they
require that the admin user has no history and that no one is currently
logged on to the server.  They also require that certain accounts not exist
yet, such as "testplayer", "testtwo", and "admintwo".  (Sometimes these
accounts can be left over from a failed test run.)  One way to
ensure the necessary conditions is to recreate the database from the
schema and reload the ECO codes using scripts/import-eco.py.

The server address and admin password for the tests can be configured
in test/test.py.  All the tests pass for me.  There are probably some
sloppy tests that depend on my particlar setup, so let me know if you
have problems.
