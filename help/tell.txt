Command: tell
Usage: tell [player] [message]
Example: tell wmahan Hello there.

Sends a tell to the [player] specified with the inputed [message]. You
can also use the "." (period) shorthand to send a tell to your most
recent chat partner (does not apply to xtells, only tells). For example,
if player "foo" was already chatting with "bar", he can type in ". lol"
to say "lol" to foo.
