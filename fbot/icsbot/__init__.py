"""Classes defined here (Please look at help(icsbot.IcsBot):
    o IcsBot: The main class.
    
Further modules provided:
    o Status: Module which provides information on online status of users.
    o Also a fiew more invisible ones, that are all accessable through IcsBot
    o parser provides some more parsing modules:
        o gamelist: Keep a up to all games being played, starting or ending
            on FICS
        o moves: Parse the moves/smoves command.
    o misc are some more tools, some useful some less so. The for sure working
        and useful are:
        o sqldata: Provides an interface to have IcsBot Data Items to be stored
            and loaded from a database automatically (they are still cached
            though)
        o pgn: Provides a pgn generator from a dictionary similar to
            parser.moves output.
        o tells: Provides a parser function to correctly parse things like:
            "asdf fds d" -t --test "fd sdfs", etc.
        o glicko: Module which knows glicko rating system (2 and 1) for FICS
            like live updating. (It does not support period based updates but
            does updates for each game immidiatly)
        o and some more ...
    o thirdparty: is a module with all third party packages. These are seperate
        from icsbot and may be licensed differently.

    """This is the base class to handle the connection (and timer).

    Functions/Classes that want to get access to FICS output need to register
    with this module. They have the following functions available to call in
    this modules instance:
        o register(regular expression object OR unparsed string, itself)
        o unregister(itself).
    Note, that due to the fact that python cleans up behind you, a
    class/function should selfdestruct when it calls unregister (unless
    you reference it from somwhere else of course).
    
    There is one more thing available for you which can be handy:
        o Use timer(time_in_epoch, function) to have a specific function
           be called when the time is reached. I am not too happy with
           the implementation, but I think its the best you will get.

    NOTES:
        o The function to first register, is the function that will
           first be tried to match for.
        o Note that the parser strips commands, so you don't need to expect
           any whitespaces, even if there “should” be.
        o If you want to parse something before the first prompt, you will need
           to register something to match it all at once.
           
    Some other variables:
        o self.READ_SIZE: amount of data the socket tries to read at once.
        o self.TIMEOUT: default timeout on the socket (Modified for the
           timer implementation). Set to None if your connection is stable,
           otherwise I will consider the connection dead when the timeout
           is ever hit. (And if your bot does almost nothing, FICS can be
           quiet)
        o self.ics: The actual socket being used (when connected).
        o self.block_code: The current block code gotten or None
    
    If ptime is set, IcsBot.fics_time will be the time (hour and minute) when
    the last command was gotten. Else it is None. The bot currently sets the
    timezone to GMT for simplicity.
