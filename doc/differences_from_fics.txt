* The error messages given when logging in (for names that are
too short, too long, or contain disallowed characters) have been
reworded for consiceness and to be more consistent with one another.

* It may take slightly longer to log in.  This is a security feature;
the password hashing algorithm is harder to crack because it requires
more computation.

* If you use the "." command to tell the last told player, and that player
has logged off, you now get the error message "PLAYER is no longer online",
rather than "I don't know who to tell that to".

* The "(shouted to N players)" given by the shout command includes the
user doing the shout (assuming that user has shouts enabled).

* Newlines are now sent after carriage returns ('\r\n'), rather than
vice versa ('\n\r').

* If an alias contains invalid syntax (such as a bare $), the server will
print an error message rather than trying to execute the command anyway.

* The "inchannel" command, when invoked on an emtpy channel, prints
"There are 0 players in channel N", rather than "Channel N is empty".

* Vars intentionally not implemented: availinfo, availmin, availmax, rated,
pgn (games are always mailed as pgn), tolerance, echo

* The following are now aliases rather than commands: "open", "bell", "flip",
"simopen", "style", "promote".  

* When attempting to send a tell to a name that does not exist or user who
is not online, the error message is "No user named HANDLE is logged in",
rather than "HANDLE is not logged in".  This is is an attempt to clarify
that the name may or may not be a registered handle.

* The "teams" list has been removed.

* Unregistered users can no longer have notification lists, nor can they be
added to notification lists. I didn't think such a feature would be useful
enough to warrant the extra complexity that would be required to implement
it.

===

Admin differences:
* The following commands now require an exact login and do not accept
abbreviations of names:  "asetadminlevel", "asetpasswd", "nuke".

for removal:
* Gods can now set their own adminlevel. Not sure if it's useful, but it
follows the principle of "gods can do anything".

* It's no longer possible go give a guest a title (athough it is still
possible to set a guest's adminlevel).
