:[09:16 PM SERVER] maeniel(12): fics allows the claim during other guys move to allow for pos 3red pre claim

:[09:20 PM SERVER] wmahan(12): but the reason you can claim a draw on the other guy's turn is because unlike otb, you can't write the move down without executing it

:[09:21 PM SERVER] wmahan(12): option 1 is simple, change nothing and leave the current behavior...not many people seem to mind but me

:[09:23 PM SERVER] wmahan(12): option 2 is only allow claiming a draw based on the current position...if you want to claim a rep, you either have to move and claim it fast, before your opp moves, or supply the move to the draw command

:[09:23 PM SERVER] wmahan(12): that's suboptimal too because your opp might premove and give you no chance, and as you say nobody knows about the draw command

:[09:24 PM SERVER] wmahan(12): option 3 is separate the claim draw and offer draw commands...that's more radical but maybe more in the spirit of fide

:[09:27 PM SERVER] wmahan(12): option 4, which I'm leaning toward really, is allow claiming draw 1) if the current position is a rep, regardless of whether it's your move, or 2) when the previous position is a rep, but only if it's your move

:[09:27 PM SERVER] wmahan(12): currently fics does 1) or 2) regardless of whose move it is

:[09:28 PM SERVER] wmahan(12): basically trying to eliminate the throwing away of your queen because you have to claim it before you move
