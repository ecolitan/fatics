            2. To edit a fields entry instead of setting it to a copy of itself
                (ie. I use this in the qtells class where the item is an
                iterator)

                other then what was specified by the user. (see also Users)
        
    ARBITRARY ITEMS:
        o Go ahead and add any items you want to store on a user (like qtell
           does for example). BUT: info gets usually deleted on disconnect,
           and make sure not to conflict with other things, also an item might be
           dropped. So if you must be sure, buffer the parent so that the weakref
           won't drop it.
           
    NOTE:
        Items are weakrefed, however during __getitem__, __setitem__ and __delitem__
        operations which can trigger other things, the garbage collector is disbabled.
        This should make it save if a dataitem is temporarily unrefed.

class Data(object):
    """
    Class to handle Data, especailly Users:
      Data[item] -> returns a item object.
    If item is a string, it is case insensitive, but item can be anything.
    The item is stored as "handle" into the Item object, probably often
    just flying around, sometimes meaning you have double entries (with db).
      
    You can change self.main_key to change the default item to a name 
    different from 'handle'. For example the ID in the database, or whatever.
      
    AS USER IS THE MAIN INTEREST, ALL HELP MAY REFER TO Users==Data
    and User == Item!
    
    Other things (ie, users.online) are added from outside.
      
    NOTES:
        o Use Registered functions to add functionality to user class.
           The registered function can change the items value by directly
           editing the User.items dictionary.
        o Registered functions are executed in the order that they are
           gotten. Classes ones are executed before Instance ones, so that
           they could modify the value before the instance thinks it changed.
           Instance ones _will_ also be executed if old == new.
    
    TIPS:
        o Instead of registering say "rating" which would be set when a
           function parsed the finger of a user, have it set
           "finger_update" = time.time() and register to that. That way you
           get notified even if the rating does not change AND always know
           when it was last updated.
        o For the same example, you might have a loader regestration for your
           database backend. The status module will set the items, but if a
           user is not connected, he does not have it set, so that loader
           gets called when you cannot get it through FICS. Yes, that means
           that you will need the dummy "finger_update" to force a reload
           through the finger function. (Of course this is rather
           hypethetical, afterall finger is always more up to date ;))
           
    Maybe the buffer should be improved ...
