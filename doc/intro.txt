 _...with ICS, it isn't the technology that is important, it's the idea_ -- [http://members.cox.net/cpetroff/FICS/Archives/1995-03-06%20Rec.Games.Chess%20-%20ICS%20to%20ICC%20discussion%20%28M%20Moore%29.txt  Michael D. Moore, March 6, 1995]

lics is a free and open source server that attempts to
replicate and improve upon the functionality of FICS, the Free Internet
Chess Server.  It is written in [http://www.python.org/ Python]
(version 2.6) using the [http://twistedmatrix.com/ twisted] framework.

= New features =
== Features for users ==
* Full support for international characters.
* Ability to change the language on the fly.
* New slow time control.
* Rating pools.
* Unlimited censor and noplay.
* Execute multiple commands with a single alias.

= Missing features =
To be fair, I should also mention what doesn't work yet.
* Lots of stuff.


= Questions and answers =

==Why a new server?==
The existing FICS server has served well and continues to work fine.
Anyone can play there for free, but unlike the original incarnation by
Richard V. Nash and Michael D. Moore, the server is neither open source
nor free software.[1]  My goal is to change that.

More tangibly, I hope to make available a number of new features and
fix bugs and limitations in the old server.

==Why start from scratch?==
An old version of the FICS source code, written is C, is still
available under a free and open source license.  This old
code is an obvious starting point for a new server, and indeed it
represents a great deal of effort toward my goal.  However, I chose
not to use it, for two main reasons:
* *Security.* C is susceptible to buffer overflows, and although it's
 a great language, it's not ideal for writing a modern network server.
 The original server uses static buffers extensively.  Auditing it for
 security holes would be difficult work, and security holes might still
 slip by undetected.  The new server is not immune to security holes, but
 it should avoid the buffer overflow class of vulnerabilities.
* *Maintainability.* A modern server should be easy to update to add new
 features and fix bugs.  I think one reason the FICS server has changed
 little in recent years is that making changes is a complex and error-prone
 process.  Understandably in my opinion, the admins have been reluctant to
 make nonessential changes.  Python is a good choice in this regard because
 readability of code is an explicit goal.

==Other projects==
There are several other projects with a similar goal:
* [http://chess.samba.org/ Lasker] is an effort by Tridge of Samba fame to
update the last open source version of FICS.  Last updated in 2002. Licensed
under GPLv2.
* [http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~chess/sources/server/ GICS] appears
to be another branch of the original FICS source with a few interesting
features like the IIC (inter-ICS communication) protocol.
* [http://chessd.sourceforge.net/index-en.html chessd] "This project is an effort to unify, correct and expand older, abandoned servers such as fics, gics and lasker." Includes an attempt at a rewrite based on XMPP and BOSH. (Perhaps
*chessd* is a confusing name because it is also the name of the binary used
by the lasker and related servers.)
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeics/ freeics] is another
attempt to create an open source server. It looks like the only download
available is the source code to mamer.
* [http://www.nongnu.org/xadrez/ xadrez] was an attempt at a completely new
server written in C++.  There is an overview paper on the site with some
interesting ideas.  Last updated in 2002.
* [http://code.google.com/p/bics-chess/ BICS] builds on lasker and
focuses on "FR bug, bronstein time control, etc.". Licensed under GPLv3.
* [http://code.google.com/p/morphy-chess-server/ Morphy] is a
rewrite in Java, by johnthegreat.
* [http://code.google.com/p/chaturanga/source/list Chaturanga] "is an open-source chess server providing interfaces for a number of clients and support for XML-RPC in order to facilitate quick development of new client applications."

If you know about any others, please add to the list.
