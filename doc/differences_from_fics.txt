* The error messages given when logging in (for names that are
too short, too long, or contain disallowed characters) have been
reworded for consiceness and to be more consistent with one another.

* It may take slightly longer to log in.  This is a security feature;
the password hashing algorithm is harder to crack because it requires
more computation.

* If you use the "." command to tell the last told player, and that player
has logged off, you now get the error message "PLAYER is no longer online",
rather than "I don't know who to tell that to".

* The "(shouted to N players)" given by the shout command includes the
user doing the shout (assuming that user has shouts enabled).

* Newlines are now sent after carriage returns ('\r\n'), rather than
vice versa ('\n\r').

* If an alias contains invalid syntax (such as a bare $), the server will
print an error message rather than trying to execute the command anyway.

* The "inchannel" command, when invoked on an emtpy channel, prints
"There are 0 players in channel N", rather than "Channel N is empty".

* Vars intentionally not implemented: availinfo, availmin, availmax, rated,
pgn (games are always mailed as pgn), tolerance, echo, ropen

* The following are now aliases rather than commands: "open", "bell", "flip",
"simopen", "style", "promote".  

* When attempting to send a tell to a name that does not exist or user who
is not online, the error message is "No user named HANDLE is logged in",
rather than "HANDLE is not logged in".  This is is an attempt to clarify
that the name may or may not be a registered handle.

* The "teams" list has been removed.

* Time odds are supported again (it appears they were removed from the
old FICS, but I could not find a posted explanation of why).

* Unregistered users can no longer have notification lists, nor can they be
added to notification lists. I didn't think such a feature would be useful
enough to warrant the extra complexity that would be required to implement
it.

* The the behavior of empty finger note lines is different. For example,
if you have only note 1 set, and you set note 5, notes 2-4 will
automatically be filled with blank lines.  Subsequently deleting
note 5 will clear notes 2-4 again.

* If you prefix a command with "$$" to avoid updating your idle time,
aliases are now expanded.  To avoid expanding aliases (the old behavior
of "$$"), use "$$$".

* If you enter a move (such as "e2e4") while you aren't playing a game,
you'll now receive the generic "Command not found" message, rather than
"You are not playing or examining a game".

===

Admin differences:
* The following commands now require an exact login and do not accept
abbreviations of player names:  "asetadminlevel", "asetpasswd", "nuke".

for removal:
* Gods can now set their own adminlevel. Not sure if it's useful, but it
follows the principle of "gods can do anything".

* It's no longer possible go give a guest a title (athough it is still
possible to set a guest's adminlevel).

=== 
Internal differences:

Rather than a global array of all challenges, each player's list of
challenges sent and received are stored separately.
