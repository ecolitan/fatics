        Modern password hashing for your software and your servers
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install bcrypt, simply:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install bcrypt
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Basic
        ~~~~~
        
        Hashing and then later checking that a password matches the previous hashed
        password is very simple:
        
        .. code:: pycon
        
            >>> import bcrypt
            >>> password = b"super secret password"
            >>> # Hash a password for the first time, with a randomly-generated salt
            >>> hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())
            >>> # Check that a unhashed password matches one that has previously been
            >>> #   hashed
            >>> if bcrypt.hashpw(password, hashed) == hashed:
            ...     print("It Matches!")
            ... else:
            ...     print("It Does not Match :(")
        
        
        Adjustable Work Factor
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        One of bcrypt's features is an adjustable logarithmic work factor. To adjust
        the work factor merely pass the desired number of rounds to
        ``bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12)`` which defaults to 12):
        
        .. code:: pycon
        
            >>> import bcrypt
            >>> password = b"super secret password"
            >>> # Hash a password for the first time, with a certain number of rounds
            >>> hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt(10))
            >>> # Check that a unhashed password matches one that has previously been
            >>> #   hashed
            >>> if bcrypt.hashpw(password, hashed) == hashed:
            ...     print("It Matches!")
            ... else:
            ...     print("It Does not Match :(")
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        This library should be compatible with py-bcrypt and it will run on Python
        2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and PyPy 2.0.
