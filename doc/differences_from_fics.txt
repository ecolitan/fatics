* If you use the "." command to tell the last told player, and that player
has logged off, you now get the error message "PLAYER is no longer online",
rather than "I don't know who to tell that to".

* The "(shouted to N players)" given by the shout command includes the
user doing the shout (assuming that user has shouts enabled).
