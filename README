This is an Internet chess server inteded to be a free software equivalant
for the server that currently runs at freechess.org.

System requirements
===================
* Linux (it might work on other OSes, but I haven't tried)
* Python 2.6 or 2.7
* Twisted 8.2 or later
* MySQL 5.0 or later
* The MySQLdb Python module
* The python-bcrypt module

Running the server
==================
First you'll need to create the MySQL database.  The server uses
localhost as the server and the username "chess" by default; these
can be changed by editing src/config.py.  The server looks in
~/.my.cnf for the password to use; for example:

# start .my.cnf
[client]
user = chess
password = your_password_here
# end .my.cnf

Once a MySQL user is set up, you can create the tables FatICS needs
using the schema in db/db.sql.  I typically do this by by running
"mysql chess" from the top of the source directory, and then
typing "source db/db.sql" at the mysql> prompt.

If there are no errers, you're ready to try to run the server.  The
command I use is (again from the top of the FatICS source tree):

  twistd --pidfile chessd.pid -r epoll -oy src/chessd.tac

This will start the server as a daemon and dump all server messages to
twistd.log.  To the server in the foreground and print messages on the
console (useful for testing and debugging):

  twistd --pidfile chess.pid -r epoll -noy src/chessd.tac

If all goes according to plan, the server will be listening on ports 5000
(and port 5001 for zipseal) and ready for you to log in.  By default the
schema creates one player named "admin" with the password "admin";
obviously it's a good idea to log in to the server and change the
password (using the "password" command) if you are testing on a machine
with ports open to the Internet.

Running the tests
=================
The test suite is run with the command

  trial test

from the top-level directory.  All the tests pass for me.  I can pretty much
guarantee that some will fail on any system other than my own, but there you
go.
