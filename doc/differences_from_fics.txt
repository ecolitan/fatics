= Changes from original FICS =

== Differences for users ==

* The server is stricter about the format of moves entered.  Moves should
be in Standard Algebraic Notation or long algebraic notation.  In particular,
moves are now case-sensitive, so that a move like bxb3 (pawn capture) is
unambiguous with Bxb3 (bishop capture).  Users of graphical clients (that
is, the vast majority of users) should not notice this change.
Rationale: Standard algebraic notation is, well, standard, but the current
case-insensitivity violates the standard.  This change will make the
server more compatible with programs that produce SAN.

* Vars intentionally not implemented: availinfo, availmin, availmax, rated,
pgn, tolerance, ropen.
Rationale: I hope they have few enough users that they can be marked
obsolete and not implemented.  Games are always mailed as pgn.  The
"tolerance" var is replaced by the new "seclude" var (see New features).
In my opinion "tolerance" was not sufficient for its stated purpose of
blocking offensive communications.  If there is still demand for a
keyword filter, it is more logically implemented on the client side.

* The error messages given when logging in (for names that are
too short, too long, or contain disallowed characters) have been
reworded.
Rationale: consiceness and consistency of messages.

* "Drawn by mutual agreement" has been shortened to "Drawn by agreement".
Rationale: conciseness.

* If an alias contains invalid syntax (such as a bare $), the server will
print an error message rather than trying to execute the command anyway.
Rationale: Avoid hiding user errors.

* When attempting to send a tell to a name that does not exist or user who
is not online, the error message is "No user named HANDLE is logged in",
rather than "HANDLE is not logged in".
Rationale: This is is an attempt to clarify that the name may or may not be
a registered user.

* The "teams" list has been removed.
Rationale: It's obsolete.

* Unregistered users can no longer have notification lists, nor can they be
added to notification lists.
Rationale: I didn't think such a feature would be useful enough to warrant
the extra complexity that would be required to implement it.

* The behavior of empty finger note lines is different. For example,
if you have only note 1 set, and you set note 5, notes 2-4 will
automatically be filled with blank lines.  Subsequently deleting
note 5 will clear notes 2-4 again.
Rationale: intended to be more intuitive.

* The "inchannel" command, when invoked on an emtpy channel, prints
"There are 0 players in channel N", rather than "Channel N is empty".
Rationale: easier for the server to generate and easier for a bot to
parse.

* If you prefix a command with "$$" to avoid updating your idle time,
aliases are now used.  To avoid using aliases (the old behavior
of "$$"), use "$$$".
Rationale: allow executing a command with aliases,
without updating idle time.

* If you enter a move (such as "e2e4") while you aren't playing a game,
you'll now receive the generic "Command not found" message, rather than
"You are not playing or examining a game".
Rationale: simplifies the server implementation slightly; hopefully
won't cause any user confusion.

* If you use the "." command to tell the last told player, and that player
has logged off, you now get the error message "HANDLE is no longer online",
rather than "I don't know who to tell that to".
Rationale: more informative.

* If a game is aborted on move 1, the printed result now includes the
name of the player who requested the abort.
Rationale: more informative.

* When setting a password, the server does not print the password back
to you, but rather replaces it with asterisks.
Rationale: make it harder from someone else to read the password
over your shoulder, although it is still visible when you type it.

== Differences for interface and bot authors ==
* Newlines are now sent after carriage returns ('\r\n'), rather than
vice versa ('\n\r'). (This affects some bots and interfaces, but typical
users should not have to worry about it.)
Rationale: Dating back to the original teletype machines, the order is
conventionally '\r\n'.

== Admin differences ==
* The following commands now require an exact login and do not accept
abbreviations of player names:  "asetadminlevel", "asetpasswd", "nuke".
Rationale: These commands should be used with great care.

== New features ==
* Full support for international characters
* Dynamically switch the language of FICS messages
* New timeseal with support for sending international characters.
===Not done yet===
* Time odds are supported again (it appears they were removed from the
old FICS, but I could not find a posted explanation of why).
* Timeseal has compression of data sent from server to client;
timeseal supports pinging.
* New "seclude" variable.  When it is set, all communications to the
user are blocked for the entire session, including personal tells,
channel tells, shouts, c-chouts, and messages, with the following
exceptions: tells by admins, announcements, tells in channel 1.  The
purpose is to allow playing without seeing potentially offensive
communications.
* New "country" variable.  The sole purpose of this var is to allow
interfaces to display a country flag for users who choose to set it.
This var is optional and should not be set by an interface without a
user's explicit permission.
* New channel features: anyone can create his or her own channel;
channel topics; messages to channels.  Channels below 1024 are
managed by admins; there should be plenty of channels above that
unofficial categories (the current limit is about 2 billion).
* Multi-command aliases: separate commands in aliases with a
semicolon (;).
* New "slow" time control, for games longer than an hour.
* Support for correspondence games.
* Rating pools.
* Automatic lag-detection features.
* Unlimited lists like censor and noplay.
* New variants; existing variant ratings split into lightning, blitz,
standard, slow, and correspondence.
* Glicko 2 ratings, which are like the Glicko FICS currently uses but
add a volatility measure.

== Changes I would like to make, but which need discussion first ==
* These commands are deprecated: "open", "bell", "flip", "simopen",
"style", "promote".
Rationale: for interface consistency, encourage always using the "set"
command to change vars. 
* A new rshout command for announcing relays, so users who do not
care about relays can "set rshout 0".  Currently announcements are used,
so it is not possible to unsubscribe.

== Changes I considered but rejected ==
* Preventing a player from logging out when starting a game: if a
player wants to log out, there's no way to stop him or her from
closing the interface.  It's better that we know the user has
intentionally logged out.
* Numbers and punctuation in player names: possible, but perhaps too
disruptive to the existing conventions and too ripe for abuse.
* International (non-ASCII) characters in names: in my opinion
this is bad because not all players can type non-ASCII characters,
which could make it difficult to finger, tell, or match users with
such names.
* Named channels (such as #help as an alias for channel 1): probably
too disruptive to established conventions.
* Multi-line messages: maybe possible for the future, but we would need
to be careful to prevent spam.
* Extra censor features like automatically expiring censor lists or
censoring but still playing users.  Basically, I think censoring should
be a last resort and don't want to encourage indiscriminate use of
censor lists, because in my opinion they are a suboptimal solution to 
antisocial behavior (maybe I should write up a more detailed explanation).

== I changed my mind about these so I need to undo them ==
* Gods can now set their own adminlevel. Not sure if it's useful, but it
follows the principle of "gods can do anything".
* It's no longer possible go give a guest a title (athough it is still
possible to set a guest's adminlevel).

== Internal differences ==
* Server is written in Python 2.6 with twisted (the original FICS
is in C).  I/O is asynchronous, and on Linux 2.6, epoll() is used for
better scalability than the traditional select().
* The server uses a relational database for better load balancing
and exporting of data to external applications like ficsgames.com.
* Game history is stored as PGN.
* Rather using than a global array of all challenges, the server
stores each player's lists of challenges sent and received separately.
* Lists like noplay and censor are stored as Python sets, which allows
tests for set membership in O(1) average time and O(n) worst-case.
* (Minor) Channel tells no longer iterate over all logged-in users, but
only users subscribed to the channel.
