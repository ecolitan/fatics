* It may take slightly longer to log in.  This is a security feature;
the password hashing algorithm is harder to crack because it requires
more computation.

* If you use the "." command to tell the last told player, and that player
has logged off, you now get the error message "PLAYER is no longer online",
rather than "I don't know who to tell that to".

* The "(shouted to N players)" given by the shout command includes the
user doing the shout (assuming that user has shouts enabled).

* Gods can now set their own adminlevel. Not sure if it's useful, but it
follows the principle of "gods can do anything".

* Newlines are now sent after carriage returns ('\r\n'), rather than
vice versa ('\n\r').
